- 剪纸很可能源于汉代，继纸张发明之后。

It's probably originated from Han Dynasty, after the invention <介词不清楚力（悲> of paper.

It probably originated from the Han Dynasty after the invention of paper.

朝代前面没加the，多了个is，本句的动词是originated，也不是被动语态啊，invention of paper是正确表达

- 从此它在中国的许多地方得到了普及。

From then on, it becomes popular in various parts in China.

parts of China才是正确表达，become的过去分词居然就是它自己，所以has become是过去完成啊啊啊

From then on, it has become popular in various parts of China

- 剪纸用的材料和工具很简单：纸和剪刀。

Paper cutting works <剪纸的材料和工具不知道怎么表达力（悲> needs materials and tools are very simple: paper and <剪刀不会写力（悲>

剪刀不会写了，这里剪纸需要的材料，可以把材料和工具做名词，而剪纸需要的做定语从句

The materials and tools that paper cutting needs are very simple: paper and scissors.

- 剪纸作品通常是用红纸做成的，因为红色在中国传统文化中与幸福相联。

Paper cuttings works is made of red papers, as red is associated with happiness in Chinese culture.

cutting多加个s，后面把are写成is，不愧是我哼哼哼啊啊啊啊啊啊，还漏了个传统的这个定语

Paper cutting works are made of red paper, as red is associated with happiness in traditional Chinese culture.

- 因此，在婚礼、春节等喜庆场合，红颜色的剪纸是门窗装饰的首选。

Therefore, red paper cutting works is first choice of decoration for doors and windows on cheerful occasion like weeding <庆典不会写力（悲> and Spring Festival.

把is换成become，first choice前面没加the；decoration应该用of做介词occasion应该用复数，ceremony，当庆典讲，复数是ceremonies，当然这个cheerful用得好（抄得新概念二最后一课的），不愧是新概念2，用词就是有逼格。

Therefore, red paper cutting works become the first choice for the decoration of windows and doors on happy occasions like wedding ceremonies and the Spring Festival.
