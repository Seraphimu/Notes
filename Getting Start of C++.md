## C++ Getting Start

### C++ Syntax

Let's break up the following code to understand it better:

> Example
> ```c++
> #include <iostream>
> using namespace std;
> int main() {
>     cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
>     return 0;
> }
> ```
Example explained

- `#include <iostream>` is a header file library that lets us work with input and output objects, such as `cout`. Header files add functionality to C++ programs.
- `using namespace std` means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.
- C++ ignores white space. But we use it to make the code more readable.
- Another thing that always appear in a C++ program is `int main()`. This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets `{}` will be executed.
