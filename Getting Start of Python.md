### Getting Start

First python file, called helloworld.py, which can be done in any text editor.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run:

```bash
python helloworld.py
```

The output should read:

```shell
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.
