- **Homogeneous Elements**: same data type.

- **Contiguous Memory Allocation:** elements in an array are stored in contiguous (adjacent) memory locations.

- **Zero-Based Indexing**: Â the first element is accessed with an index of 0, the second with an index of 1, and so on.

- ****Random Access****: O(1).

- One-Dimensional: which consists of a single row of elements,

- Two-Dimensional: onsists of rows and columns
